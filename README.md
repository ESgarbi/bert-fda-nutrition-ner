# bert-fda-nutrition-ner



This repository contains a PyTorch implementation of a BERT-based Named Entity Recognition (NER) model. The model is fine-tuned to identify and classify nutritional components in accordance with FDA guidelines using combined synthetic data for training. It utilizes the `bert-base-uncased` architecture and follows the BIO tagging scheme for entity recognition. The goal of this project is to accurately identify various nutritional entities such as vitamins, stimulants, proteins, and more.
