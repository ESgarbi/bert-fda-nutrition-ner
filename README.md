# sgarbi/bert-fda-nutrition-ner

This repository presents a PyTorch implementation of a BERT-based Named Entity Recognition (NER) model meticulously fine-tuned to identify and classify nutritional components in accordance with FDA guidelines. Built on the `bert-base-uncased` architecture, it aims to provide precise identification of a wide array of nutritional entities such as vitamins, stimulants, proteins, and more, using the BIO tagging scheme for entity recognition.
